# This is how i install linux arch in differant ways
- dual booting
- on a vm

# when i install arch on my pc without dual booting i just use the linux arch install script by doing

```
pacman -Syy
pacman -S archinstall
archinstall
```

#### i do the pacman -Syy to make sure my pacman is synced
#### i then install archinstall to make sure its all up to date and working
